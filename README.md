# Continual Learning Benchmark Datasets Repository

## Description

This repository contains four series of datasets designed as benchmarks for continual learning (CL). These datasets are focused on cyber intrusion events and are divided into two categories - the benchmark datasets for target system and the benchmark datasets for non-target system.

## Datasets

The benchmark settings included in this repository are as follows:

1. **Infil-8-Target**: This benchmark setting simulates a sequence of eight Infiltration attack events of a target system.
2. **Dos-10-Target**: This benchmark setting simulates a series of $10$ attack events that solely involve four types of DoS attacks for a target system.
3. **All-20-Target**: This benchmark setting is explicitly designed for CL studies, aiming to analyze the performance of CL methods when several attack types reappear in later tasks, yet the techniques employed for these attacks significantly differ among the tasks.
4. **All-10-NonTarget**: This benchmark setting simulates a series of $10$ attack events for a non-target system.

Each benchmark setting provides unique insights and can be used to build robust and effective continual learning models for cybersecurity applications.

## Usage

To use these datasets, clone the repository and navigate to the desired dataset folder. Each folder contains all the necessary files pertaining to the specific benchmark setting.
